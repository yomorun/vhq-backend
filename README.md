# YoMo Showcase: Implement an Virtual HQ Presence Service with Geo-Distributed Cloud 

This showcase demonstrates how to build a realtime [Presence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presence_information) Sync Service of [Metaverse Workplace - Virtual Headquarters](https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/virtual-hqs-race-to-win-over-a-remote-work-fatigued-market/) with Geo-distributed Cloud Architecture by [YoMo](https://github.com/yomorun/yomo) and [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/).

Nowadays, users care about low-latency event streaming. But backend services usually deployed to a dedicated cloud region and CDN is used for static resources. We need a CDN-like architecture but for upstreaming data and realtime computing. This showcase introduce a easy way to reach the goal.

## 🧑🏼‍🏫 Architecture Explanation

There are 3 parts in this Realtime Presence Sync Service: 

1. **Websocket Server**: accepts WebSocket connections from Web Browsers
2. **Presence Sender Service**: a YoMo Server responsible for dispatch presence to other nodes 
3. **Presence Receiver Service**: a YoMo Server responsible for recieving presence from Senders

By YoMo, we create an event stream from Bob to Alice, sync all presence from Bob to Alice. Assume Bob and Alice are both in Europe, they connect to the same mesh node:

</p>

But When Bob is in Italy 🇮🇹 while Alice is in US 🇺🇸, the presence flow will be like below, it's done automatically by YoMo:

In this showcase, we separate presence sync flow to 2 parts, one is `Sender`, responsible for `Dispatching presence`, another is for `Receiving presence`. Every `Sender` will dispatching presence to every `Receivers`:

</p>

YoMo care about security, presence in `Sender` and `Receiver` are encrypt by TLS v1.3 by default on [every datagram](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-quic-tls-34):
